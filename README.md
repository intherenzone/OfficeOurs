Description
-----------
OfficeOurs is an Android app developed to keep track of commonly searched
information related to college professors. Mainly, this app keeps track of the
professor's office hours, courses, office number, TA hours, and contact
information.

The app was built to solve a very common problem among college students, and
to be more specific, computer science students at the University of Maryland. As
a computer science student at UMD, we are provided with a wide array of sources
for course information. These sources include:
        + ELMS
        + Piazza
        + CS Class Web Pages
        + Professor Personal Web Page
This can be extremely overwhelming, especially during syllabus week.
As such, we felt it extremely useful to consolidate this information for the
student. Additionally, in accordance with our vision for making this information
easily accessible, we aimed for minimal design and user input.
